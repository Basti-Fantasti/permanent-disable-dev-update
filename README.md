Permanently block firmware updates for specific Home Assistant devices.

Useful when a device's firmware must not change:
- custom WLED boards that brick on other than stock firmware
- Zigbee coordinators running patched firmware that would lead to a broken setup if updated
- devices with known-broken upgrade paths

Home Assistant's "Skip" button is per-version, not permanent. This integration
provides a persistent block list that survives restarts, re-pairs, and
integration reloads.

## How it works

When a device is blocked, its `update.*` entity is disabled via the entity
registry. No notifications, no install button, and no install service call
succeeds. A shadow sensor exposes the last-known `latest_version`, refreshed
during a configurable nightly scan window by briefly re-enabling and
re-disabling the entity.

## Installation

### HACS

Search for "Update Blocklist" in HACS → Integrations and install it. Restart Home Assistant, then add the integration via Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → "Update Blocklist".

### Manual

1. Copy `custom_components/update_blocklist/` into your HA config's `custom_components/` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Add the integration via Settings → Devices & Services

## First-time setup

Click Add Integration → Update Blocklist. No inputs needed, defaults apply.
Open the "Update Blocklist" entry in the HA sidebar to manage blocks.

## Scan window

Defaults: scan starts at `01:00`, runs for up to 30 minutes, per-device timeout
300 seconds. During the window, blocked entities are briefly re-enabled so HA
can refresh the latest-version information, then re-disabled.

Edit these in Settings → Devices & Services → Update Blocklist → Configure.

## Services

| Service | Description |
|---|---|
| `update_blocklist.block` | Block a device. Fields: `device_id`, `reason` (optional). |
| `update_blocklist.unblock` | Remove a block by `block_id`. |
| `update_blocklist.scan_now` | Refresh a single block's shadow version. Field: `block_id`. |
| `update_blocklist.scan_all` | Run a full scan cycle across all blocks. |

## Entities

**Per block:**
- `sensor.<device>_blocked_update_status` - last known latest version
- `binary_sensor.<device>_update_blocked` - on while block is active (diagnostic)
- `button.<device>_scan_now` - one-shot rescan

**Integration-level:**
- `sensor.update_blocklist_blocked_count`
- `sensor.update_blocklist_last_scan_run`
- `sensor.update_blocklist_next_scan_at`
- `button.update_blocklist_scan_all`

## Tested environments

The panel is verified to be readable and usable on both desktop and mobile viewports. The add-block and block-detail dialogs fit phone screens and the block detail rows have proper label/value spacing.

## Limitations

- During the scan window, a brief update notification may appear for a device
  if a new version was detected between re-enable and re-disable.
- If you re-pair a blocked device, the integration will detect it by unique_id
  or fingerprint and prompt you to re-apply the block.
- Only device firmware updates are blockable. HACS / HA Core / HA OS / add-on
  updates are out of scope.

## Development

Backend tests:

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

## Translations

English and German ship with the integration. To contribute a new language,
copy `custom_components/update_blocklist/translations/en.json` to
`translations/<code>.json` and translate the strings. Open a pull request.

## Contributing

Contributions and feature requests are welcome. If you want to work on something, open an issue first so we can discuss the requirements and agree on an approach before you write code. This avoids wasted effort and keeps the integration coherent.

AI-assisted development is fine and encouraged, but "AI-assisted" means you understand what the code does and stand behind it. Pure vibe-coded fixes - where AI writes the code and it gets submitted without review or understanding - will not be accepted. If in doubt, just get in touch first.
