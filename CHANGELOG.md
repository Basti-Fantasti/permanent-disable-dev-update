# Changelog

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- Persistent block list stored in HA `.storage` — survives restarts, reloads, and re-pairs

- Shadow sensor per block exposing `last_known_version` and `last_scan_at`
- Binary sensor per block for scan-fault detection
- Rescan button entity per block

- Rediscovery prompt in the panel for user-assisted re-mapping of orphaned blocks
- Services: `block`, `unblock`, `scan_now`, `scan_all`
- Config flow with options for scan start time, max duration, and per-device timeout
- English and German translations
